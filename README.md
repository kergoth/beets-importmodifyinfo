The [ImportModifyInfo](https://github.com/kergoth/beets-importmodifyinfo) Plugin for [Beets][] applies modify-like operations on import to alter the metadata received by importers. This is largely intended to correct issues with imported metadata which would otherwise be lost on running `mbsync`, for example. This plugin is inspired by the [ImportReplace][] Plugin and my old [modifyonimport][] plugin.

## Installation

As the beets documentation describes in [Other plugins][], to use an external plugin like this one, there are two options for installation:

- Make sure it’s in the Python path (known as `sys.path` to developers). This just means the plugin has to be installed on your system (e.g., with a setup.py script or a command like pip or easy_install). For example, `pip install beets-importmodifyinfo`.
- Set the pluginpath config variable to point to the directory containing the plugin. (See Configuring) This would require cloning or otherwise downloading this [repository](https://github.com/kergoth/beets-stylize) before adding to the pluginpath.

## Configuring

First, enable the `importmodifyinfo` plugin (see [Using Plugins][]).

Describe plugin configuration here.

## Using

Describe plugin usage here. Please see the [Command-line Reference] for the command-line interface.
